Virtual-Network-Management
==========================

Virtual Network Management
In this project, we have simulated communication between different slaves through a shared bus that is managed by a management unit. The right to transfer data between slaves is mutually exclusive, i.e. no two slaves can send data on the bus at the same time. Different resource access protocols exist for sharing a single bus, e.g. TDMA, taking-turns and random access. We have chosen taking-turns to simulate this communication framework. This is due to the fact that this method is efficient in terms of utilizing the shared bus.
